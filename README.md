A bad Minecraft mod for 1.19.1 that adds a 'snitch pressure plate.' It's a weighted pressure 
plate that when stood on by a player outputs the amount of reports that player has sent in one 
session, up to a max of 15. 

This idea was inspired by [BadModdingTips](https://twitter.com/BadModdingTips) and 
[asie](https://twitter.com/cbrzeszczot) through 
[this conversation](https://twitter.com/cbrzeszczot/status/1553662135472984066).

Now you can't want chat reporting removed, I've made a mod that depends on it! >:(
